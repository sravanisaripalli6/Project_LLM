# Project_LLM
This project focuses on automating credit card transaction extraction, 
categorization, and analysis. 
By leveraging optical character recognition (OCR) with pytesseract and Named Entity Recognition (NER), 
transaction data is extracted and categorized into relevant merchant names. A large language model (LLM) is integrated to enable natural language querying, 
allowing users to easily retrieve spending patterns and insights. 
This system improves the accuracy of transaction analysis and enhances the user's ability to interact with their financial data in an intuitive and efficient way.
